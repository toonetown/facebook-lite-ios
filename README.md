# Facebook Lite
I got sick and tired of the slow loading of the Facebook app on iOS, and I really like the ad blocking of Safari, so I created a quick-and-dirty app which just loads https://www.facebook.com into a single Safari View Controller.  This project is the result of that work.

It just overrides `SFSafariViewController` and loads the URL.

This project is templated based upon the project at https://github.com/toonetown/sfsafariview-template
